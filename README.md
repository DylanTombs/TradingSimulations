# Transformer-Powered Trading Simulator

A powerful **backtesting framework** built on [Backtrader](https://www.backtrader.com/) that integrates a **custom Transformer model** for time series forecasting. This project demonstrates how deep learning ‚Äî specifically a **Transformer trained on market features** ‚Äî can be used to guide trading decisions in a systematic, backtestable way.

## üîç Project Focus

This project is **centered around a Transformer neural network** that I have created and trained on multivariate financial time series data (price + technical indicators). It uses the model's **future price prediction** to influence live trading decisions within a backtesting simulation.

## üß† Strategy: `RsiEmaStrategy`

This strategy is a **hybrid of deep learning and technical analysis**:

- Uses RSI + EMA for signal confirmation
- The core decision logic is driven by my **Transformer model** trained to predict the `close` price based on a feature-rich window of past data
- Trades are only triggered when both the **Transformer prediction** and traditional indicators align

### Input Features to Transformer:
- `close`
- `volume_zscore`, `rsi`, `macd`, `overnight_gap`, `return_lag_1`, `return_lag_3`, `return_lag_5`, `volatility`

### Trigger Logic:

```python
If RSI < 40 and Predicted Close > Current Price * 1.005 ‚Üí BUY
If RSI > 60 and Predicted Close < Current Price * 0.995 ‚Üí SELL
